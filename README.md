Messaging web app

Tasks: -
1. Working Multiple Users Web App without Encryption.
   user1 data ----> Server -----> user2
2. Encryption to be added.
   user1 -----> data encryption  -----> Server -----> data decryption -----> user2
3. Check whether any transformation of our React Web App can be converted into React Native based Mobile Application.
   If not create a mobile app which will just access our server, where whole working will take place.
4. Give the user a auto reply feature, like if user1 isn't interested in chatting with user2, auto reply will be come rescue.

If Auto Reply is a Success we can also convert this project to PPL project....
